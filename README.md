# Supervised Learning
It is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.

I am using *boston housing* data sets, which is provided by [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html)

## Linear Regression
The linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms

Formula: `y = a*x + b`.

`y` is the dependent variable (that's the variable that goes on the y axis)

`x` is the independent variable (i.e. it is plotted on the x axis)

`b` is the slope of the line

`a` is the y-intercept
